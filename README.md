<h1>Basic Authentication Mechanism using the Spring Security</h1>
<p>In this project I have exposed a Rest Endpoint using the Spring boot and created a WebSocket Client using the spring-web socket library to connect with a WebSocket server. 
<p></p> This connection is a bidirectional, full-duplex communication channel, allowing the client and server to exchange two-way data simultaneously</p>

<h2>Project Usecase:</h2>
<p>Exposed the Rest Endpoint to get the data and then send it to the server using the WebSocket</p>
<p>To Secure our exposed API Endpoints I have implemented the Basic Authentication Mechanism using Spring-Security.</p>
